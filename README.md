#  **Frontend Optimization Practices**


---

##  **1. Code Splitting & Performance Optimization**

Code splitting divides your code into smaller bundles, loading only what's necessary, improving performance and reducing initial load times.

---

##  **2. Dynamic Import**

Dynamic imports allow modules to be loaded on-demand, optimizing loading time by avoiding unnecessary scripts at the initial load.

---

##  **3. Lazy Loading & Suspense**

Lazy loading defers the loading of components until they are needed. **Suspense** provides fallback content while components are being loaded.

---

##  **4. Progressive Web App (PWA)**

PWAs offer app-like experiences, featuring installability, offline functionality, and responsiveness, enhancing the user experience across devices.

---

##  **5. Offline Availability**

Offline availability ensures your application continues functioning without a network connection by caching assets using service workers.
